* Task
What: Please collect some statistic from your github account with
 scripts, it require github token to access, it is easy.
- scripts: https://github.com/format37/git_statistic
* Short report
I added tqdm to see progress and replaced OpenAI with GigaChat.

result files:
- [[file:project_overview.md]]
- [[file:report_rwa.html]]
- [[file:report.html]]
- [[file:project_timeline.html]]
- [[file:cat_retriever.org]]
- [[file:report.png]]
* Full report
** Report
After reading poorly written README and quick glance at code I
 collected information. see [[info]]:


After reading the poorly written README and taking a quick glance at
 the code, I collected the information. See [[info]].

Then I found that there is an OpenAI dependency not documented in
 requirements.txt.

I added a patch with the tqdm library to see the progress, and after
 15 hours, the GitHub statistics were collected.

I sent the file with the collected statistics, git.csv, to the person
 assigned to the task.

He sent me the OpenAI key and a link to download an unknown binary
 application that provides a VPN.

Instead of installing the potentially malicious VPN, I have been
 trying to use TOR and OpenVPN on my VPS, but without quick
 success. After that, I rewrote the code to comply with the GigaChat
 API.

I converted Jupyter ‘.ipynb’ to Org ‘.org’ for Emacs. [[file:cat_retriever.org]]

I rewrote the code quickly and poorly (in comfortable for me Org
 format) because the whole project is poorly implemented and requires
 a lot of rework.

I checked files quickly and sent back solved task.

# Requirements
This is a collection of scripts:
- download.py - download all "requirements.txt",.py, .ipynb files from git account and generate “git.csv” file.
  - uses PyGithub
- cat_retriever.ipynb - read “git.csv” file and with help of ChatGTP describe “Libraries”,
  - create: 'repos.json', 'cat.json', 'enabled_categories.txt'.
- report.py - read 'cat.json', 'git.csv', 'enabled_categories.txt' and with help of plotly generate 'report.html' file.
- timeline.py - read 'git.csv' and generate 'project_timeline.html'
- md_report.py - read 'git.csv', 'cat.json', 'repos.json' and generate 'project_overview.md'
